# Project description

Make a countdown app. The user enters the amount of time for the clock to run and it starts counting down to 0.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For this project we need to have Node Js installed (https://nodejs.org/es/download/).

All the following commands are executed in the terminal of the computer

### `node --version`
To check if we have nodejs installed

### `npm install create-react-app -g`


### `create-react-app (name-project)`
To install the base project


### `cd .\(name-project)\`
Now your project is set up in a new directory.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm install react-bootstrap --save`
Include React Bootstrap in your project


## Important concepts of the project:

* React Components - re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface.
* ES6 importing and exporting - a new syntax for sharing code between separate files. Used in cases like `import React from ‘react’`
* State - the pertinent data to an application. Each component has its local state as long as you declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object.
* Updating State - When updating state, make sure to never mutate state directly. Doing so will lead to fatal errors in your application. Instead, re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the setState() function to update state.
* Props - similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties.
* LifeCycle Methods - events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen, or during state updates. One example is the `componentDidMount()` lifeCycle hook.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
